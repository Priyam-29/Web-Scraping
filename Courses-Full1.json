      "Title": "The Architectural Imagination",
      "Description": "Architecture engages a culture\u2019s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian. Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations. The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history. In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture. The final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society\u2019s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture\u2019s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.

While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. Future Cities aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.",

      "Description": "Cities are first and foremost built for people, and in today\u2019s world, people produce large amounts of valuable data, thus contributing to what we call \u201csmart cities.\" As almost every building and every city is a prototype, these communities are in the early stage of development and require specific attention and expertise as we advance. Smart cities, such as Zurich and Boston, consist of human-made structures or environments that are, in some capacity, monitored, metered, networked and controlled. With this functionality, combined with stationary sensors and mobile devices, data and information have become the new building materials of future cities. Using this data, citizens are now beginning to influence the design of future cities and the re-design of existing ones. In this architecture course, you will learn the basics of information cities and urban science research, as well as how dynamic behavior and citizen-driven learning differentiate the responsive city from the smart city. The cities we present and develop in this course use the stocks and flows of information as the main drivers of change. To deepen your knowledge of smart cities and give a perspective on the future of these cities, we also introduce the concept of citizen design science, a combination of citizen science, urban design, and cognitive design computing. Participants will furthermore have unique access to a design research platform for citizen design science. The intelligent use of data and information is at the core of this course, and these concepts will be the next generation of participatory design and design computing environments. This course is part of the \u201cFuture Cities\u201d XSeries, and builds on the experiences from our first two urban MOOCs: Future Cities and Livability in Future Cities.",

And, cities generate more than 70% of the global emissions? Large cities and their hinterlands (jointly called metropolitan regions) greatly contribute to global urbanization and sustainability challenges, yet are also key to resolving these same challenges. If you are interested in the challenges of the 21st century metropolitan regions and how these can be solved from within the city and by its inhabitants, then this Sustainable Urban Development course is for you! There are no simple solutions to these grand challenges! Rather the challenges cities face today require a holistic, systemic and transdisciplinary approach that spans different fields of expertise and disciplines such as urban planning, urban design, urban engineering, systems analysis, policy making, social sciences and entrepreneurship. This MOOC is all about this integration of different fields of knowledge within the metropolitan context. The course is set up in a unique matrix format that lets you pursue your line of interest along a specific metropolitan challenge or a specific theme. Because we are all part of the challenges as well as the solutions, we encourage you to participate actively! You will have the opportunity to explore the living conditions in your own city and compare your living environment with that of the global community. You will discover possible solutions for your city\u2019s challenges and what it takes to implement these solutions. Your participation will also contribute to wider research into metropolitan regions as complex systems. We invite you to take the first steps in understanding the principles that will be essential to transform metropolitan regions into just, prosperous and sustainable places to live in!

      "Description": "This is a comprehensive, dialogue-based course providing an in-depth exploration of the vernacular concept and its applications to the culture and built environments of the past, present, and future. Designed to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course will challenge the perception of tradition and stimulate a deeper analysis of one's local environment.\nFundamentally, vernacular implies a distinct local expression in building or language, and raises questions of identity, tradition, and transmission. This course presents a broad understanding of the vernacular with emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, including topics such as indigenous building materials, the ideas of use and tradition and the vernacular landscape. Much of the Asian vernacular built heritage emerges from the assimilation of different cultures with immigration and trading patterns circulating throughout the region, providing both explicit and subtle references to the countries of their origin. As such, Asia serves as an ideal platform for the investigation into vernacular systems around the world. While the various countries that play host to the course's discussions are found mainly in the Asian region, the diversity of cultures represented allows for students from any background to find common ground and familiarize themselves with the topics covered, increasing their understanding of vernacular architecture in their own surroundings.\nThis is a 5-week introductory course with videos, readings, interactive engagements, assessments and discussion forums. Each week, a new discussion topic will be raised, followed by a panel discussion with guest instructors and site visits to various locations relevant to each topic. Relevant readings will be assigned and the course will be graded based on weekly assignments and short quizzes.",

Included in this broad timeframe are artists of the importance of Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Vel\u00e1zquez, Rembrandt, Vermeer or Goya. Painters during this period were concerned with ideas such as the pursuit of beauty, the pleasures and pains associated with love, the demonstration of power and status, or the relationship of men and women to the divinity and to nature. In paintings from the period covered in this course we find traces of the emergence of the modern mind set, and information on issues such as the respective roles of women and men in the world. The classes will focus on images of paintings by the artists listed in the course syllabus. The discussions that will take place in the \u201ccourse forum\u201d will allow us to touch upon a broader range of issues.",

Six compact classes are comprised of lectures, interactive exercises, group discussions, and interviews with prominent philanthropists Warren Buffett, Doris Buffet, Cal Ripken, Jr., Soledad O'Brien, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (Ben and Jerry), Tom Werner, and Patrick Dempsey. Students will also be invited to nominate nonprofit organizations in their communities to receive real-dollar grants. A minimum of $100,000 will be distributed to the organizations ranked highest by students using a peer-review selection process based on course concepts.\nTo receive a certificate of completion, students must complete 1-2 brief exercises per class, participate in discussion sessions, and complete weekly assessments of their peers' grant nominations. All students are welcome, but not required, to submit grant nominations.\nEdX is proud to support to the The Learning by Giving Foundation and to offer the Giving With Purpose course on edx.org. As a not-for-profit, edX is proud to support organizations looking to affect global change.\nNote to students: The grant making associated with Giving With Purpose is currently limited to nonprofit organizations in the United States.

However, you will be able to apply many of the principles the course will cover about investing in high performing nonprofit organizations anywhere in the world.

La s\u00e9lection des projets d\u2019investissements et leur financement sont des questions cruciales pour les entrepreneurs ou managers. D\u2019une mani\u00e8re plus large, les d\u00e9cisions prises par le monde politique en mati\u00e8res financi\u00e8res influencent directement ou indirectement le quotidien des citoyens. Les r\u00e9centes crises financi\u00e8res ont pu nous montrer \u00e0 quel point il peut \u00eatre primordial de comprendre les fondamentaux de la finance. Sans un minimum d\u2019\u00e9ducation financi\u00e8re, il est difficile d\u2019appr\u00e9hender le fonctionnement du monde dans lequel nous \u00e9voluons. Ce cours introductif vous propose un cadre conceptuel et des outils pour vous aider \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions financi\u00e8res judicieuses, avec un focus particulier sur les op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res courantes. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAu terme de ce cours, vous serez capable de\u00a0:\n\n\nD\u00e9crire les principes fondamentaux du raisonnement financier : absence d\u2019opportunit\u00e9s d\u2019arbitrage dans un march\u00e9 concurrentiel, int\u00e9gration de la dimension temporelle et du risque dans la d\u00e9cision financi\u00e8re\u00a0;\nCalculer des valeurs actuelles ou futures, de flux ou de s\u00e9quence de flux\u00a0;\nAppliquer les techniques de l\u2019\u00e9valuation actuarielle aux op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res courantes (de type \u00e9pargne ou emprunt) et aux principaux actifs financiers (actions et obligations)\u00a0;\nUtiliser les diff\u00e9rents outils de s\u00e9lection d\u2019investissement pour des projets en entreprise\u00a0;\nAnalyser la probl\u00e9matique de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019investissement, en tenant compte du lien entre rendement attendu et risque\u00a0;\n\n\nD\u00e9terminer le taux de rendement qu\u2019une entreprise doit utiliser lorsqu\u2019elle doit prendre une d\u00e9cision d\u2019investissement et utiliser ce taux pour calculer la valeur g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e par un projet\u00a0;\nSuivre des cours de finance plus avanc\u00e9s (finance d\u2019entreprise, gestion de portefeuille, march\u00e9s financiers, finance internationale, produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s, etc.).\n\n\nFinance is everywhere and financial decisions impact all of us. Everybody is one day or the other required to save or borrow money. Both investment and financing decisions are key for entrepreneurs or managers. In a broader way, financial decisions made by politicians affect directly or indirectly citizens in their everyday lives. The recent financial crises have also shown that understanding the fundamentals of finance might be paramount. Without a minimal financial literacy, it is hard to apprehend the functioning of the world wherein we evolve. This introductory course aims at providing you with a conceptual framework and tools to help you make sound financial decisions, with a particular focus on common financial operations.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAt the end of this course, you will\u00a0be able to:\n\n\nDescribe the basics of the financial reasoning : absence of arbitrage opportunity in a competitive market, decision-making based on both time and risk\u00a0;\nCalculate present or future values of cash-flows or sequences of cash-flows\u00a0;\nApply the principles of valuation to value common financial operations (savings or loans) and main financial assets (stocks and bonds);\nUse different criteria to select investment projects in firms\u00a0;\nAnalyze capital budgeting problems, involving the relationship between expected return and risk ;\nDetermine the return a firm should use when facing an investment decision, and use this return to compute the value generated by a project ;\nTake more advanced courses in finance (corporate finance, portfolio management, financial markets, international finance, derivative securities, etc.).\n\n\n\u00a0Ce cours est enseign\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais.

      "Title": "An Introduction to Credit Risk Management",
      "Description": "You are a bank and a big part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately for you, lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or, in a less extreme situation, the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system, so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks, together with market risk and operational risk, a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging. At the end of the course, the students will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course.",

      "Title": "Communicating Strategically",
      "Description": "Far too frequently, the people who have the most to say have the hardest time saying it. Many of the best minds in our society, our most talented employees and our most promising students, fail to have the impact they could because of ineffective strategies for communicating their ideas and insights to others.\nOne problem is that communication training often happens early in a student\u2019s academic career. Most college students get some training in communication, usually as a required freshman course. These courses can be very helpful, but these courses often cover information that, with out practice, is often forgotten. By the time these students begin to develop expertise in specific disciplines and begin working in certain industries, the communication needs become specialized and more challenging.\nThe second problem is that many people often underestimate how hard it is to effectively communication and think they do a better job than they actually do. After all, their content makes sense to them, and if someone else doesn't understand, it must be their fault.\nA third problem is that some people don't want to communicate. They don't feel it is their job. They want to focus on their own technical areas of expertise. Perhaps they fear it a little because it is not their \"area\" or they simply dismiss it as unimportant. Either way, such beliefs ultimately become constraints on their own success and run counter to the expectations of others who oversee their work. So, avoiding communication is usually not an option.\nThis five-week refresher course is designed to attempt to boil down essential components of communication strategy and is geared toward improving professional presentations, especially those where experts (scientists, engineers, and other technical professionals) are attempting to communicate with non-scientists, usually management, to inform organizational decision-making.",

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of current social problems and how policy is formulated, alongside the ability to tell that story in a manner that drives an otherwise apathetic public into action.\n\u00a0\nThe goal of this online course is two-fold:\u00a01)\u00a0to teach students of journalism, public policy and social work how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and\u00a02)\u00a0have those students become effective change agents themselves. This class is not theoretical \u2013 students should be prepared to dig in deep and make meaningful contributions to policy change on both the state and federal level.\nAt first glance, prospective students may find the subject matter \u2013 Child Maltreatment and Vulnerable Children \u2013 narrow. But, choosing a single issue area is a deliberate choice. If this course were structured more broadly, with a host of different issues, the effectiveness of each student\u2019s contribution would be limited. Instead Journalism for Social Change intends to leave each student with the\u00a0experience\u00a0of being a player in promulgating policy reform around the issues facing vulnerable children. Further, the umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts.\n\u00a0\nIn as much, student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis students will substantively contribute to public discourse on this issue, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues vulnerable children face.\n\u00a0\nWith that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.",

Whether you work with embedded systems, mobile computer-based systems, or cloud systems, performance and energy efficiency are key drivers of usability and competitiveness of computerized products. In this course, you will learn how to design modern multicore-based computers, and how the design choices you make affect performance and energy consumption. You will explore design principles governing modern microprocessors, such as pipelining and cache memories, as well as methods for determining the impact of your design on execution time and energy efficiency. These skills can make a difference for practicing engineers for the purpose of building highly competitive products. Take, for instance, a smartphone with limited battery capacity. By adding value to end users through new or improved functionality, this can lead to significantly shorter operation time between battery charges, thus utilizing the already limited resources of a smartphone far more efficiently. With this skillset, you can become an expert in computer system performance and energy efficiency - knowledge that is in high demand when designing computerized embedded products. With trends towards IoT (Internet of Things), autonomous systems and mobile computers, such a skillset will be critical in a career in systems engineering.

Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society.

It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it\u2019s for everyone\u2026 join us!",

      "Description": "Computing is an art. Computing is also, for most people, magic; this course will enable you to see what lies beyond the apparent magic, and to discover the science behind computing.\nInformation Technology is everywhere. Every aspect of human activity depends on it. All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software. In this course we lift the hood and explain how to write this software. If you do not just want to be a consumer of IT services but understand how they work, and contribute to them yourself, this course is for you.\nThe core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few \u00e2\u20ac\u015blines of code\u00e2\u20ac\u0165, but writing quality programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches to write good programs.\nThe course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.\nThroughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems, provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser.\nBeyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today's IT-based world possible. You should expect to devote five hours weekly to the course. Remember that you can only learn programming in depth by writing programs, so the more you practice the better.",

Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.\nFunctional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, \u00a6 support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.\nThis course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.\nOnce you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to \"think like a fundamentalist\"\u0165, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to \"code like a hacker\"in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook's novel Hack language as our main example.\nThis course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.",

Curious how radio designers and spectrum regulators avoid harmful interference within a network or among different wireless services? Debating whether television (TV) band spectrum or cellular spectrum is more valuable to society? \u00a0Want to build a radio transmitter and receiver, or develop a business plan for a wireless network deployment in your hometown? \u00a0Then sign up for \"Understanding Wireless\" today!\n\u00a0\nThis survey style course offers an opportunity to gain understanding of the technical, regulatory, and economic aspects of the mobile wireless revolution and its impact on society. \u00a0The course is intended for a broad audience, from engineers to business majors to aspiring lawyers, but students will be most comfortable if they are not intimidated by early-college mathematics.\n\u00a0\nThe instructors aim to expose the intricate physics, infrastructure, industry segments, markets, and radio frequency (RF) spectrum challenges behind today's popular smart phones and tablets, and to challenge students to participate in fueling the future growth of these technologies as well as their applications. The course will include such topics as the electrical transmission of information, the physical propagation of radio signals, the principles and challenges of sharing a common medium, standards and patents, spectrum licenses and auctions, privacy and security issues, and societal impact of wireless communication services and applications.\nIn addition to directed readings, video sessions, and learning exercises, students taking the course for a certificate will be required to take several quizzes and, in the last two weeks of the course, to develop a project selected from one of several options. We are excited to introduce you to the myriad aspects of the wireless revolution and to explore with you how wireless is changing today\u2019s society.",

In this economics course, you will learn the basic stylized framework that economists use to think about, account for, measure and explain these complex interactions and outcomes. In the first half of the course, we consider how households decide how much to work and how to spend and save money. We will also look at how businesses make economic decisions such as how many workers to hire and how many machines and buildings to use to produce their products. In the second half of the course, we consider how different policies can potentially enhance or distort market outcomes by offsetting, alleviating, or amplifying these inefficiencies. Our focus will be on five aspects of economic policy: labor market policies and unemployment R&D and innovation policies fiscal policies and taxation monetary policy and inflation free-trade policies This course satisfies the Social-Behavioral Sciences (SB) general studies requirement at Arizona State University.

Democratic governments, in principle, can be criticised freely and are answerable to those they seek to govern. By contrast, managers are not, in general, answerable to those they seek to manage, and the mildest criticism can be dangerous. The central questions of this course are: What would happen if workers ran their own firms? Would worker-managed firms take the same decisions as their capitalist counterparts? Could such an economy be efficient? What policies could be deployed to promote a cooperative sector? The internal impact of employee ownership: productivity, governance and management. The external impact of employee ownership: spillovers for health, democracy, and the local economy. Simple economic theory of the labour managed firm. The \u201cPangloss Theorem\u201d (if cooperatives are so wonderful, why aren\u2019t there more of them?) Internal versus external financing. Performance bonds and wage-earner investment funds. Degeneration thesis and policies to counter it. Kibbutzim, Pacific plywood cooperatives, Mondragon. Cooperativism in the finance sector (with a comparative international focus): building societies, credit unions, etc. Community renewables: economic democracy in action. There is widespread interest around the world in cooperatives as an alternative to the capitalist corporation, particularly since the financial crash of 2008. Economics and other social sciences can focus and sharpen the debate on cooperatives. Having taken the course, students will be better placed to participate in public discussion on cooperatives, or to join a cooperative or even start a new one.

Most modern societies depend on markets to organize economic activity: they are market economies. A large number of decisions you make as individuals or as managers relate to markets.

In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.\nThe overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health.

      "Description": "Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it\u2019s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn\u2019t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one\u2019s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.\nThe purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.\nBy the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.\nCourse goal:\nThe goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:\npurposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,\npossesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,\nis compassionate towards self and others,\ndemonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and\nfocuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.\nCourse supporting objectives: When you complete this course, you will be able to:\nDescribe why \u2018functioning from the inside out\u2019 is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person\nExplain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life\nDirectly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:\nMindfulness practices\nStrategies to manage intense emotions\nActivities that induce positive emotions\nClarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them\nMaking health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being\nDescribe why \u2018practicing\u2019 and integrating resilience skills into one\u2019s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person\nDevelop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future",

What strategies can help students deal with the emotional highs and lows? How can academic advisors, family and friends help research students cope with these stresses - and celebrate the successes?

In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics - from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system.",

      "Description": "Organic electronic materials are defined broadly as carbon-based materials that are capable of transporting charge both in liquid-supported systems and in the solid state. While the exact molecular architectures of the materials may vary based on the desired functionality and ultimate device application, these materials do not necessarily rely on a high degree of crystallinity or band-like transport to shuttle charges in response to stimuli (e.g., an applied electric field). This is in direct contrast to many systems based on inorganic semiconductors and conductors.\n\u00a0\nTraditionally, two classes of these organic electronic materials have emerged: 1) small molecules and 2) polymers. While each class has its own set of positive aspects, drawbacks, processing conditions, and the ultimate cost-effectiveness many of the fundamental transport physics between the two classes of materials remain the same, although some distinctions do exist. In this course, we will draw on the similarity and distinctions of these two classes. Furthermore, we will evaluate how these materials can be implemented successfully in established (e.g., organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices) and emerging (e.g., thermoelectric (TE) generators) organic electronic modules. In this way, we aim to train the students of the course in the ability to tie molecular transport phenomena with macroscopic device response such that they are well-prepared to analyze, troubleshoot, and design the next generation of organic electronic materials and devices.\n\u00a0\nThis course is the latest in a series offered by the\u00a0nanoHUB-U\u00a0project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines though short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering.

      "Description": "Imagine how your life would be without electricity to power the devices you use at home and in the office, without reliable drinking water from the tap, without cars, trains and air traffic, without your mobile phone and without internet access. In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them, we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure, uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change, as they are becoming more and more web-based, transnational and privatized, while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict. In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design, management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed: What are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development? What makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future? How can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved?",

Together we\u2019ll explore how structures work, why they were designed the way they were designed, how they support loads, and where forces flow through them. More specifically we\u2019ll: Learn about funicular forms and how ropes and cables resist tension. Discuss how columns, arches, and anti-funicular forms resist compression. Discover how trusses, beams and walls resist loads. \u2022 Sketch the flow of forces through structures. Compare and contrast different structural forms and systems to answer a range of questions such as: Why might an engineer choose a beam over a truss? How do the dimensions of a structure affect its response? How do engineers choose forms and systems to create structures that are both elegant and functional?

At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. We will consider: linear elasticity (recoverable deformation at small displacements), viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material). Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.",

Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around the Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller.\nUseful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along. More experienced students will be able to dig deeper into optional modules that cover advanced concepts in analog circuit design. Some of these have been developed by practicing engineers in industry who know the tricks of the trade and have decided to share some of their insights to enhance the course.\nThe philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an honor code certificate from BerkeleyX.\nAdditionally, a kit of electronic components costing under is available from Newark element14. Ordering pages are now available for North America, Europe, and Asia regions. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Additionally, some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter and an oscilloscope. The NI MyDAQ with myProtoBoard has been made available for students who would like to use this measurement equipment to follow along with the course.\nCreativity is encouraged! Students that are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience.\nMyDAQ Information\nThose who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the myDAQ and the myProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course. Take a look at the MyDAQ ordering page. \u00a0Other alternatives are listed in the course Wiki.Parts Kit Information\nThe parts included in the construction of the robot can be purchased at Newark's landing page:All Regions\nThis kit is optional, but highly recommended to get the most out of the course.

Many people want to eat a healthier diet but are torn between the numerous conflicting and very confusing messages thrown at us by healthcare professionals, self-professed nutrition consultants, journalists, and even academic scientists. Every day you hear about a new fad diet with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d success rate that promises a long and healthy life or simply causes your fat to melt away. Most people lack a basic understanding of nutritional science to judge whether these messages carry any credibility. Under the mantra \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d this course will teach you the basics of human nutrition and provide you with a solid background to understand and appreciate the importance of nutrition for human health.",

We will study the politics surrounding the GMO and its impact at both an individual level and to society as a whole; including the problems, perceptions, benefits, and risks associated with GMOs. Important to understanding the complexities around this topic we will not only be looking at the science behind how the GMO works, but also to the limitations of this science. We will also discuss the importance of information literacy as a tool for effectively identifying and evaluating issues. Our goal is that this MOOC will impact people's understanding of science, what it can and can't do, and how information is transmitted. The intent is not to influence how people feel about GMOs, but to give them the critical thinking and scientific literacy tools necessary to make informed decisions \u2014 and to understand the broader impacts of those decisions.",

One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time we may be warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame or MSG. Dietary supplements may be touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on. This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micro nutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the best science available.

If you choose to join this five-week course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with \u201cvirtual patient scenarios\u201d will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your life.\nWe\u2019ll start the first week by looking at what makes us motivated to change our behavior. We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model, which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a \u201cvirtual bartender\u201d who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2), improving sleep (week 3), increasing physical activity (week 4), and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing, condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use.",

      "Title": "Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care",
      "Description": "For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.\nAs the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.\nIn this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!",

It develops a toolkit of analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. The teaching team, four physician-anthropologists, draws on experiences working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas, to investigate what the field of global health may include, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:\nA global awareness. This course aims to enable students to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and wellbeing. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.\nA grounding in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.\nAn ethical engagement. Throughout the course, students will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Students will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities\nA sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could, all too easily, engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, students learn that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world's poorest and suffering people.",

We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.\nThis course is part of the series, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American histor The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery.\u00a0 It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality.\u00a0 The series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves.

Finally, ethical leadership asks the question of values in reference to ultimate concern. Course participants will engage with the course in a number of ways including the development of an Ethical Leadership Toolkit (ELT). The ELT is an instrument for leaders who engage the complex ethical questions in public space and includes the following: Ethical Leadership Model; Ethical Decision-Making Model; Ways of Doing Ethics; Remembering, Retelling and Reliving Stories; and Looking, Listening and Learning. Participants will be invited to develop their own Ethical Leadership Toolkit through video exercises led by Professor Fluker, survey questions, discussion forums, journaling and assessments. Students who pass this course are eligible to take a 6 week online addendum course and receive graduate credits as a non-matriculating student from Boston University.

Sometime known as the age of \u201cthe Hundred Schools of Thought,\u201d this period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought, which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. Important themes to be discussed include conceptions of the self, models of self-cultivation and rationality, and differences in spiritual and political ideals. Students will be exposed to both received texts and recently discovered archeological texts; this combination of sources will both enrich students\u2019 understanding of the world of thought in early China and call into question the boundaries drawn between the traditionally-defined \u201cschools\u201d such as Daoism or Confucianism. Parallels with developments in Western philosophical and religious traditions will be highlighted. We will also explore the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, as well as the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.",

      "Description": "If you are unable to access Youtube, the introductory video is available via XuetangX.\nWe make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.\u00c2\u00a0 Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a natural d\u0102\u00a0o.\nWe will look at two rival directions this natural d\u0102\u00a0o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d\u0102\u00a0o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Medieval Chinese Buddhism.\nAlthough Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.",

All organisms, from single-celled algae to complex multicellular organisms like us, are made up of cells. In this course, you will learn the how and why of biology by exploring the function of the molecular components of cells, and how these cellular components are organized in a complex hierarchy. This course is designed to explore the fundamentals of cell biology. The overarching goal is for learners to understand, from a human-centered perspective, that cells are evolving ensembles of macromolecules that in turn form complex communities in tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms. We will focus, in particular, on the mitochondrion, the organelle that powers the cell. In this context, we will look at the processes of cell metabolism. Finally, we will examine the F1F0 ATP synthase, the molecular machine that is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP that your cells require to do work. To underscore the importance of cell biology to our lives, we will address questions of development and disease and implications of science in society. By the end of four weeks, we hope learners will have a deep intuition for the functional logic of a cell. Together we will ask how do things work within a cell, why do they work the way they do, and how are we impacted? Join us as we explore the extraordinary and wonderfully dynamic world of the cell.

What are the risks of being vaccinated vs choosing not to be? How does hunger lead to obesity, and how can we address the exploding health care costs that consume 16% of the nation\u2019s GDP? What is the range of sexual behavior that biology offers? How can I see evolution happen right before my eyes?\u00a0 What causes massive extinctions and what are their impacts on the planet? If we found life on another planet, what could it be like? Will there be a cure for cancer? Will we defeat aging? These are some of the topics we will cover in this course.",

But the process of focusing light into image on the back of the eye and translating it into meaningful nerve signals is incredibly complex. The retina and visual cortex are packed with intricate processing circuitry, and have been a mystery to neuroscientists for centuries. Now, answers are beginning to emerge.\n\u00a0\nToday, the visual system is often called the model system for neuroscience: its findings are relevant to all other areas and to investigating the deeper mysteries of the brain\u2019s microstructure and function. In this course, we take you from the physics of focusing light onto the retina, to the processing of colors, form, and motion, and finally to the interpretation of visual information in the cortex. We distill the mysteries of the visual system by posing questions and investigating them in a series of thematic, animated videos.

And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions.\nHow does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results.

      "Description": "When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect. \u00a0You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. \u00a0Statistics can be confusing and opaque. \u00a0Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged\u2014even fearful and resentful.\n\u00a0\nBut in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it\u2014from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information? \u00a0One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.\n\u00a0\nThe purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach\u2014you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.\n\u00a0\nYou do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops.\nBut by the end of the course you will be able to:\nIdentify the most important features of a data set\nSelect a statistical test based on the features of the data\nThink like a statistical detective\nUnderstand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables\nPerform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data\nHopefully, love stats!\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.",

Start by exploring statistics with R!\nSkilled persons who can process and analyze data are in great demand today. In this course you will explore concepts in statistics that help you make sense out of data. You will learn the practical skills necessary to find, import, analyze and visualize data. We will take a look under the hood of statistics and equip you with broad tools for understanding statistical inference and statistical methods. You will also get to perform some really complicated calculations and visualizations, following in the footsteps of Karolinska Institutet\u2019s researchers.\nYou are probably reading this course description because you know that statistics and statistical programming are essential skills in our golden age of data abundance. Let\u2019s say it again: Health science has become a field of big data, just like so many other fields of study. New techniques make it possible and affordable to generate massive data sets in biology. Researchers and clinicians can measure the activity for each of 30000 genes of a patient. They can read the complete genome sequence of a patient. Thanks to another trend of the decade, open access publishing, the results of such large scale health science are very often published for you to read free of charge. You can even access the raw data from open databases such as the gene expression database of the NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information.\nIn this course you will learn the basics of R, a powerful open source statistical programming language. Why has R become the tool of choice in bioinformatics, the health sciences and many other fields? One reason is surely that it\u2019s powerful and that you can download it for free right now. But more importantly, it\u2019s supported by an active user community.\u00a0In this course you will learn how to use peer reviewed packages for solving problems at the frontline of health science research. Commercial actors just can\u2019t keep up implementing the latest algorithms and methods. When algorithms are first published, they are already implemented in R. Join us in a gold digging expedition.

Some place the origin of dogs over 100,000 years ago; others place the start of dogs just 12,000 years ago. Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between. Diverse scholars have suggested dogs arose as trash scavengers or as hunters\u2019 helpers.

      "Description": "Have you ever wondered about planets in other solar systems? Have you ever thought about the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe? For the first time in human history, we know that planets around other stars not only exist, but are common!\nAlien Worlds focuses on the search and characterization of planets orbiting other stars (called extrasolar planets or \"exoplanets\"\u0165). Over the course of nine modules, we will learn some of the techniques used to discover the thousands of known exoplanets and will discuss how we can use basic scientific tools to characterize the sizes, masses, compositions, and atmospheres of exoplanets. We will also learn about the diversity of stars in the Galaxy to understand how stellar properties affect exoplanet detection techniques and influence planetary formation and habitability.\nIn addition to the exploration of exoplanets, students in Alien Worlds will gain a basic understanding of light, gravity and motion, and be introduced to some of the most extreme life on planet Earth. We will hear from experts at the forefront of exoplanet science and interact with other participants and instructors through social media and online tools. Students will leave Alien Worlds with a better understanding of their place in the Universe and the skills to comprehend the wealth of new discoveries surrounding the countless worlds around distant stars.",

      "Description": "The discovery of exoplanets is one of the greatest revolutions in modern astrophysics. Twenty years ago, we had no idea whether any of the countless stars out there beyond our solar system had planets or not. Today, things are totally different. Over one thousand planetary systems have been discovered. The universe is teeming with planets. And what strange planets they are - hot Jupiter-like planets skimming the surfaces of their stars, cold and lonely free-floating planets far from any star, planets made of diamond, planets with rain made of glass, super-Earths and even planets orbiting neutron stars. In this course we\u2019ll bring you up-to-date with the latest research on exoplanets, and how it has revolutionised our understanding of the formation of solar systems like our own. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level Maths and Physics to get the most out of this course. This is the second of four ANUx courses which together make up The Australian National University's first year astrophysics program. It follows on from the introductory course on the Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe. It is not necessary to have done the introductory course first: all necessary background material is repeated here. It will be followed by courses on the violent universe and on cosmology.",

As we gain scientific understanding into the causes and nature of such phenomena, we become better able to mitigate the effects of disasters. Yet as the world's population continues to grow, an increasingly large number of people are at risk. This course examines the science behind different types of disasters and our ability or inability to control and predict such events. From this course the student will gain an appreciation of natural disasters beyond the newspaper headlines, and will better understand how the effects of disasters can be reduced.\nThere is an urgent need for people from all walks of life to better understand the scientific principles behind the occurrence of natural disasters. City planners need to know where and where not to site buildings. Politicians need to make scientifically informed decisions. Emergency management officials need to understand the nature of a potential disaster and ways to mitigate such an event. Journalists need to report scientifically accurate information.",

      "Description": "Water is essential for life on earth and of crucial importance for society. Also within our climate water plays a major role. The natural cycle of ocean to atmosphere, by precipitation back to earth and by rivers and aquifers to the oceans has a decisive impact on regional and global climate patterns.\nThe MOOC will cover six main topics:\nGlobal water cycle. In this module you will learn to explain the different processes of the global water cycle.\nWater systems. In this module you will learn to describe the flows of water and sand in different riverine, coastal and ocean systems.\nWater and climate change. In this module you will learn to identify mechanisms of climate change and you will learn to explain the interplay of climate change, sea level, clouds, rainfall and future weather.\nInterventions. In this module you will learn to explain why, when and which engineering interventions are needed in rivers, coast and urban environment.\nWater resource management. In this module you will learn to explain why water for food and water for cities are the main challenges in water management and what the possibilities and limitations of reservoirs and groundwater are to improve water availability.\nChallenges. In this module you will learn to explain the challenges in better understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on water for the coming 50 years.\nEvery module is made by an expert, so you will learn from different professors. Although the different topics are taught by different professors the course line is clear and will be explained and connected by our anchor man. Examples in the environment will be given by Max, our reporter on location. The course consists of knowledge clips, movies, exercises, discussion and homework assignments. The course will be finished by an examination. The best students (based on results and activity in the forum discussions) will be invited to follow an online course of the MSc-track Water management of the faculty of Civil Engineering at the TU Delft. Together with the courses \"Introduction to drinking water treatment\" and \"Introduction to the Treatment of Urban Sewage\" they form the Water XSeries, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, TU Delft.",

Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.\nThis course parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. \u00a0This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is\u00a0exciting; using those rules to predict\u00a0correctly something that you haven\u2019t observed means that you\u00a0really understand something. It\u2018s a great feeling.\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?\nYou need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, including:\nalgebra \u2014 including solving systems of 2 or 3 equations in as many unknown quantities, simplifying expressions, factoring, etc.\ntrigonometry \u2014 the unit circle, definition of the standard trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverse functions), radian measure for angles, the law of cosines\ngeometry \u2014 basic properties of circles, triangles, rectangles, parallel lines\nfunctions \u2014 if the\u00a0x\u00a0position of an object is a function of time\u00a0t, how to graph\u00a0x(t) given some functional form, and understanding that such an expression means that the\u00a0x\u00a0position has a unique value for all values of\u00a0t\u00a0[often in a finite range of times, to be sure]\ndifferential calculus \u2014 the meaning of the derivative of a function of a single variable and how to compute derivatives for common functions\nintegral calculus \u2014 the meaning of the integral of a function, how to compute simple integrals using common strategies (substitution, including trigonometric substitution, parts, etc.)\nYou may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.\nThere is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take to find out if your mathematics background is good to go.",

RealityX investigates the limits of knowledge and what we can and cannot know of the world and ourselves. We will trace the evolution of ideas about the nature of reality in philosophy and the natural sciences through the ages. Starting with the philosophers of Ancient Greece and ending with cutting edge theories about the universe, quantum physics, and the nature of consciousness. Learners who complete this course will be able to: A. Communicate with others about the latest scientific discoveries in various disciplines including cosmology, quantum physics, mathematics, machine intelligence and cognitive science. B. Identify key points in history where scientific advances changed humanity\u2019s philosophy and understanding of the nature of reality and our place in the Universe. C. Reflect on and examine their own worldview and identify if any changes occurred during this course. D. Confidently argue about scientific evidence, philosophical viewpoints, and others\u2019 interpretations of both. E. Demonstrate how the scientific method works, its limitations, and how scientists use it to construct knowledge about physical reality. Join world-renowned physicist and author Marcelo Gleiser and leading experts as we explore how philosophers and physicists from Plato to Einstein and many others have attempted to explain the nature of the world and of reality.

We\u2019ll be taking you on a tour through ignorance in all its varieties and guises. Ignorance is everyone\u2019s business. Ignorance is relevant to every discipline and profession, and to everyday life, both at work and at play. No matter what domain you study or work in, this course will have something to offer to you. We will explore questions about ignorance such as the following: Where does ignorance come from? How do we impose it on each other, and even on ourselves? And why? We usually think about ignorance as a bad thing, but when can it be preferable not to know something? What uses do people have for ignorance? What roles does ignorance play in social interaction, group relations, institutions, and law? Can ignorance sometimes be a virtue? When can ignorance be good or bad for us? How can we harness the unknown for learning, discovery, and creativity? How can we make good decisions under ignorance? Your understanding of ignorance will be expanded via online games, discussion forums, opportunities to find out what your own \u201cignorance profile\u201d is, additional readings, and Wiki materials. There also will be discussion threads specifically for those of you who want to apply understandings about ignorance to complex social and environmental problems. Knowing more about ignorance will help you to manage it and work with it. It also will help you in dealing with the unexpected, with complex problems, and even wicked problems.",
