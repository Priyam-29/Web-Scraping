      "Description": "Architecture engages a culture\u2019s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian. Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations. The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history. In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture. The final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society\u2019s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture\u2019s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.

In this course, we will explore the ancient cities of Chang'an of Han, Luoyang of Northern Wei, Chang'an and Luoyang of Sui and Tang, Kaifeng of Song and Dadu of Yuan, and delve into the history of the awe-inspiring ancient buildings that still grace the landscape of these bustling cities. The course will cover construction and aesthetics of these imperial palaces, religious structures, pagodas, tombs and gardens. We will study the basis of Chinese architecture, the wood framed building, as well as the brick and stone construction of many Buddhist pagodas and tombs. The course will culminate in an examination of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the ancient royal garden at the Chengde Mountain Resort, and the private gardens of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

      "Description": "Are you an urban planner, designer, policy maker or involved or interested in the creation of good living environments? This course will broaden your scope and diversify your take on the field of urban planning and design. We will focus on a unique Dutch approach and analyze how it can help those involved with urban planning and design to improve the physical environment in relation to the public good it serves, including safety, wellbeing, sustainability and even beauty. You will learn some of the basic traits of Dutch Urbanism, including its: contextual approach; balance between research and design; simultaneous working on multiple scale levels. You will practice with basic techniques in spatial analysis and design pertaining to these points. You will also carry out these activities in your own domestic environment. This course is taught by the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU-Delft, ranked no. 4 in Architecture/Built Environment on the QS World University Rankings (2016). All the material in this course is presented at entry level. But since the course has an integral perspective, combining planning and design aspects, it can still be relevant for trained professionals who feel they lack experience in either field.

      "Description": "China's architectural history spans thousands of years. In this course, we will explore the ancient cities of Chang'an of Han, Luoyang of Northern Wei, Chang'an and Luoyang of Sui and Tang, Kaifeng of Song and Dadu of Yuan, and delve into the history of the awe-inspiring ancient buildings that still grace the landscape of these bustling cities. The course will cover construction and aesthetics of these imperial palaces, religious structures, pagodas, tombs and gardens. We will study the basis of Chinese architecture, the wood framed building, as well as the brick and stone construction of many Buddhist pagodas and tombs. The course will culminate in an examination of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the ancient royal garden at the Chengde Mountain Resort, and the private gardens of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

      "Title": "The Architectural Imagination",
      "Description": "Architecture engages a culture\u2019s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian. Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations. The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history. In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture. The final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society\u2019s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture\u2019s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.

      "Description": "Cities are first and foremost built for people, and in today\u2019s world, people produce large amounts of valuable data, thus contributing to what we call \u201csmart cities.\" As almost every building and every city is a prototype, these communities are in the early stage of development and require specific attention and expertise as we advance. Smart cities, such as Zurich and Boston, consist of human-made structures or environments that are, in some capacity, monitored, metered, networked and controlled. With this functionality, combined with stationary sensors and mobile devices, data and information have become the new building materials of future cities. Using this data, citizens are now beginning to influence the design of future cities and the re-design of existing ones. In this architecture course, you will learn the basics of information cities and urban science research, as well as how dynamic behavior and citizen-driven learning differentiate the responsive city from the smart city. The cities we present and develop in this course use the stocks and flows of information as the main drivers of change. To deepen your knowledge of smart cities and give a perspective on the future of these cities, we also introduce the concept of citizen design science, a combination of citizen science, urban design, and cognitive design computing. Participants will furthermore have unique access to a design research platform for citizen design science. The intelligent use of data and information is at the core of this course, and these concepts will be the next generation of participatory design and design computing environments. This course is part of the \u201cFuture Cities\u201d XSeries, and builds on the experiences from our first two urban MOOCs: Future Cities and Livability in Future Cities.",

   "Title": "The Architectural Imagination",
   "Description": "Architecture engages a culture\u2019s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian. Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations. The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history. In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture. The final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society\u2019s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture\u2019s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.

   "Description": "Are you an urban planner, designer, policy maker or involved or interested in the creation of good living environments? This course will broaden your scope and diversify your take on the field of urban planning and design. We will focus on a unique Dutch approach and analyze how it can help those involved with urban planning and design to improve the physical environment in relation to the public good it serves, including safety, wellbeing, sustainability and even beauty. You will learn some of the basic traits of Dutch Urbanism, including its: contextual approach; balance between research and design; simultaneous working on multiple scale levels. You will practice with basic techniques in spatial analysis and design pertaining to these points. You will also carry out these activities in your own domestic environment. This course is taught by the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU-Delft, ranked no. 4 in Architecture/Built Environment on the QS World University Rankings (2016). All the material in this course is presented at entry level. But since the course has an integral perspective, combining planning and design aspects, it can still be relevant for trained professionals who feel they lack experience in either field.

   "Title": "Future Cities",
   "Description": "Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. Future Cities aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.",
