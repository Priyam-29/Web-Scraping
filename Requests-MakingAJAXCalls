AJAX requests are not the same as that of HTTPRequests
They require additional information to be passed to the server with the call
In our case it was x-requested-with aram in the header specifying the type of the request i.e. XMLHttpRequest

Call looks something like this:
        subjectURL = "https://www.coursebuffet.com/sub/computer-science"
		s = requests.Session()
		r = s.get(subjectURL)
response = s.get(url='https://www.coursebuffet.com/search.js?q=&sub=15&prov=&uni=&tag=&gen_level=0%2C600&page=1',
						 headers={
							 'x-requested-with':'XMLHttpRequest',
							 'Referer':'https://www.coursebuffet.com/sub/computer-science'
						 })
